//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I don't know what is my "root_path", what can i do ?
Put a PHP script on your web site whith the following code : <? phpinfo(); ?>
Copy the path next to the var "OPEN_BASEDIR". (Without the last "/", if there is one).
If you see "no value", then look for PATH_TRANSLATED (without the trailing filename).
Example : PATH_TRANSLATED is d:\www\phpinfo.php3
The root path will be d:/www
If your host hide those variables, chooser another host !  ;o)

- My login and passwords are right but i'm redirected to the "index.php3" page ?
The var "$installurl" is invalid, check it in the "prive/conf.php3" file.

- What is the directory "logs" for ?
It contains files with users parameters. Those log files are created at each connection and deleted at each deconnection,
or 24 hours laters if not.

- An error occured after uploading files.
If your PHP version is greater or equal to 4.0.3, try this line :
if (!copy($userfile, "$destination/$userfile_name"))
instead of :
if (!move_uploaded_file($userfile, "$destination/$userfile_name"))
in the "index.php3" file.

- An error occured after uploading files on a Windows NT server !
In the PHP.INI you must specify the upload_tmp_dir, ie to C:\TEMP. 
Also, in some versions of PHP, you must set magic_quotes_gpc to Off.

- I can't upload files greater than 2 Mb !
You need to increase the "upload_max_filesize" value in the PHP.INI file. It is set to 2097152 bytes (2 Mb) by default.
Don't forget to increase "max_execution_time", in order to avoid time outs from sever.
To upload large files, check also "post_max_size" and "memory_limit".
